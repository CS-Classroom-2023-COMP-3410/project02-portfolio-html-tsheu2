Timothy "TJ" Sheu

To start development, I focused on starting with my home page. I wanted this page to be the hub for all the other pages. It includes a short video and some introductions. My favorite part of this page was embedding a video. I then moved onto the other pages, aiming to have each focus on a different aspect of me or my theme. 

The biggest issue I ran into was formatting. I had some issues with formatting the tables and gallery photos at first. But after doing some research, it became very simple and straightforward.
